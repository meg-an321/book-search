## Description
Bootcamp students were asked to convert from RESTful API practices to a GraphQL API.

This assignment includes:

- Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API,
- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API,
- Creating an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server, and
- Deploying the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
